Part of this is because the technology is still in its youth and adoption still hasn\u2019t reached the masses, although the path towards real mass adoption is getting clearer by the day. The Problem of centralized funds still persists as a lot of coins and tokens are in the hands of a few big players in the industry.</p> <p>In order to further disperse these financial resources and give everyone a fair chance of participating in an independent market, exchanges mark a pivotal point. A widespread allocation is only possible if there are a lot of different - ideally independent and decentralized - exchanges that grant access to assets with each acting as a sort of contingency for another, avoiding risk of corruption.</p> <p>The requirements for those exchanges are steadily rising and rightfully so. Investors want to be able to voice their concerns when putting their hard-earned money at risk and the weight of their voice has been rather small in the past. It's clear that it's one of the major challenges for exchanges and DeFi projects to empower the individual investors and give them the right to vote on important decisions. With growing desire for participation comes the question on how to meet the needs of the growing crypto community.</p> <p>SwapDEX Chain offers its users' participation through an elaborate voting and consensus mechanism that strives to best represent the interest of each one of their investors through nominating the most trustworthy validators (nodes that supply the blockchain with the hardware necessary) and voting upon a trusted council to ensure long term stability of the chain and the trading D'Apps deployed on its native SwapDEX Chain.</p>"},{"location":"#why-swapdex","title":"Why SwapDEX?","text":"<p>Back in the early 2000s, when the internet was gaining popularity for the first time, the internet featured read-only, static, basic web pages.

SDX and KSI are utilizing a {=Proof-of-Stake=} consensus mechanism to agree on processes like block authoring and finality.  As the name implies, staking plays an essential role on both networks.  </p> <p>In short, you have two options to stake. Either you stake in the form of nomination, or you stake by running a validation.  But staking, in general, means that you bind your SDX or KSI holdings for a specific purpose and time to receive rewards in return. </p> <p>This guide will mainly focus on helping you decide to become a nominator or a validator and give you some examples of the rewards you could expect.</p> <p>Validator</p> <p>The staking system on SwapDEX and Kusari is designed to pay out rewards equally to all validators, regardless of their stake.

A validator pool consists of the stake of an elected validator together with the nominators backing it. The nominator pool consists of the sum of nominated coins for that validator.</p> <p>As you can see in the illustration below, every validator pool receives essentially the same amount of coins for equal work. The network distributes the coins at the end of each era.

If a validator's commission is set to 100%, no coins will be paid out to any nominations in the nominator pool.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"deep-dives/staking/#rewards-mechanism","title":"Rewards Mechanism","text":"<p>By now, two concepts should be clear:</p> <ul> <li>Every validator pool is rewarded equally regardless of the total stake captured by that validator pool</li> <li>Smaller validator pools tend to reward nominators more per coin then pools with more stake. </li> </ul> <p>Notice that the reward mechanism gives nominators economic incentives to favor smaller validator pools. The reason behind that is to prevent a concentration of power among a small set of validators. </p> <p>Furthermore, it is in alignment with the principle of risk and reward. The smaller the validator pool, the higher the risk that the validator may have a bad reputation or inferior performance and the higher the reward per staked coin.</p> <p>Notice that there is no limitation of nominators that can stake on a validator, but there is a limitation of nominators a validator can pay rewards to. This condition is called oversubscribed. That said, once a payout on an oversubscribed validator takes place, only the top number of nominators are considered. So pay attention to signs of oversubscription.</p> <p>Warning for Validators and Nominators</p> <p>We also remark that when the network slashes a validator slot for misbehavior (e.g. validator offline, Equivocation, etc.) the slashed amount is a fixed percentage (and NOT a fixed amount), which means that validator pools with more stake get slashed more coins. Again, this is done to give nominators an economic incentive to shift their preferences and support less popular validators they consider trustworthy.</p> <p>Another point to note is that each validator candidate is free to set their desired commission fee (as a percentage of rewards) to cover operational costs. Since the network pays all validator pools the same, validator pools with lower commission fees pay more to nominators than pools with higher fees. Thus, each validator can choose between increasing their fees to earn more or decreasing their fees to attract more nominators and increase their chances of being elected. In the long term, we expect that all validators will need to be cost-efficient to remain competitive. Validators with a higher reputation will charge slightly higher commission fees (which is fair).</p>"},{"location":"deep-dives/staking/#accounts","title":"Accounts","text":"<p>To add an extra layer of protection, we advise creating two types of accounts:</p> <ul> <li>Controller Account</li> <li>Stash Account</li> </ul> <p>The Stash account is your cold wallet which holds your funds and delegates some functions to the controller account.

You can change them regularly; your controller account only needs to create a certificate by signing a session public key and broadcast this certificate via an extrinsic.</p> <p>Our blockchain uses three session keys: - GRANDPA: ed25519 - BABE: sr25519 - I'm Online: sr25519</p>"},{"location":"deep-dives/substrate_keys/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Account keys are essential to blockchains because they allow you to control your funds. The blockchain publishes your public keys to the network, as the name implies. Your wallet address is an excellent example of a public key. Your private key, in contrast, should be protected and kept secret at all times because, with the private key, anybody could move your funds.</p> <p>Our blockchain uses controller keys (a second wallet) to speak for your main wallet's stash keys (public and private keys) that control your funds. However, the controller keys are limited to just acting on behalf but are never capable of making a transaction. This Setup of a \"hot\" wallet (controller) that you use to engage with the network and the \"cold\" wallet (stash) that holds the funds grants you an extra layer of security.</p> <p>Finally, Session keys are generated by the validator node itself and used by the validator to perform network actions continuously. You can change session keys at any time.</p>"},{"location":"dev-guides/","title":"Smart Contracts","text":"<p>On SwapDEX you have two out-of-the-box solutions to kickstart your Smart Contract development.</p> <ul> <li>The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) pallet, which presents an Ethereum compatibility layer</li> <li>The Contracts pallet, which is a FRAME library for Wasm based smart contracts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"dev-guides/#evm-contracts-by-frontier","title":"EVM Contracts by Frontier","text":"<p>Frontier is the Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate chains.

Any language that compiles to Wasm can potentially be used to write smart contracts. Nevertheless, it is better to have a dedicated domain-specific language, and for that reason Parity offers the ink! language.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rent. Contracts must pay rent or else hold a deposit suitably large enough in order to justify its existence on-chain. When a contract does not uphold this, it may create what's called a tombstone which is a reference to the contract. In some conditions, the contract will be deleted outright along with its storage if it does not maintain these requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Caching. Contracts are cached by default and therefore means they only need to be deployed once and afterward be instantiated as many times as you want. This helps to keep the storage load on the chain down to the minimum.

Well, to make a long story short... SwapDEX is one single chain BUT it runs an ethereum simulation in parallel.</p> <p>How does this work?</p> <p>To answer this question, we need to look at the node architecture. Nodes are the pillars of our distributed network, and they run all the necessary code.</p> <p></p> <p>I want to direct your focus to the SUBSTRATE RUNTIME module of the Substrate Node.  The Runtime hosts all the code that makes SwapDEX unique, and it's composed of code pallets.  As you can see, the democracy function of our chain is also a code pallet and allows our community to govern the chain. Likewise, the staking pallet enables our community to run validators and stake as nominators. Like those pallets, the EVM is another pallet that allows our community to interact with eth-based smart contracts and cross-chain bridges.</p> <p>By performing the transfer described in step 01, we are transferring coins from the SUBSTRATE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT into the EVM pallet and vice versa, that's it :D.

Part of this is because the technology is still in its youth and adoption still hasn\u2019t reached the masses, although the path towards real mass adoption is getting clearer by the day. The Problem of centralised funds still persists as a lot of coins and tokens are in the hands of a small number of big players in the industry.</p> <p>In order to further disperse these financial resources and give everyone a fair chance of participating in an independent market, exchanges mark a pivotal point.

By following the train of this assertion, one might assume that SwapDEX's governance is susceptible to becoming ruled by a few large token holders (called whales in trading parlance) and therefore become a mere plutocracy (rule of the rich). There are several other mechanisms that are built-in to the governance system to resist this plutocratic tendency. One of these mechanisms is called conviction voting, and imposes greater voting power to token holders who are willing to lock their tokens on the protocol for longer lengths of time. Longer lock-ups display conviction in a vote. Conviction voting could allow a highly determined minority to overrule the vote of an apathetic majority in certain situations. Another mechanism is known as Adaptive Quorum Biasing. This makes proposals have a varying threshold for approval or rejection based on what part of the governance protocol the proposal originated in.

The most likely reason for being in the waiting list is that the amount of SDX nominated (staked) is not high enough to be in the top 300. The amount of nominated (staked) SDX on your validator will determine if you can make it into the top 300. You can go to the targets page of the explorer to check your rank and see how much is needed for you to move into the active set of validators here (sort for total stake and check which has the least amount to be eligible for the next era to determine the threshold)</p> <p>Other reasons may be connectivity issues from you or your providers side.

It is a collection of peer-to-peer protocols for finding peers and connecting to them. Its modules have logic for content routing, peer routing, peer discovery, different transports, and NAT traversals. It is intended to be used by applications for building large scale peer-to-peer networks by only selecting the parts of the protocol suite that are needed. The Rust implementation of the specification was built and primarily maintained by a team of contributors at Parity Technologies. The Go and JavaScript versions are maintained by Protocol Labs as well as community contributors. A Nim version of the library also exists. Libp2p as a whole is an open source project that is actively developed and expanded on various code repositories hosted on their GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"home/FAQs/#does-swapdex-use-libp2p","title":"Does SwapDEX use libp2p?\u200b","text":"<p>Yes, since SwapDEX is built with Substrate. Substrate uses a networking protocol that is based on libp2p (specifically the Rust libp2p library). However, Substrate uses a mix of standard libp2p protocols and protocols that are homegrown and not official libp2p standards. Of the standard protocols, those which are shared with other implementations of libp2p such as IPFS, are connection-checking (ping), asking for information on a peer (identity), and Kademlia random walks (kad). Of the protocols that are custom to Substrate, there are the legacy Substrate stream, a request-response for getting information on blocks (sync), a light client protocol, a notification protocol for transactions, and block announcement. For detailed information on how Substrate uses libp2p and the standard and custom protocols, please see the networking documentation.</p>"},{"location":"home/FAQs/#how-does-libp2p-differ-from-ipfs","title":"How does libp2p differ from IPFS?\u200b","text":"<p>The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol used primarily for storage of files.

Either switch to an account that has the necessary permissions, or check if the operation you're trying to execute is permitted at all (e.g. calling\u00a0system.setCode\u00a0to do a runtime upgrade directly, without voting). BadProof The transaction's signature seems invalid. It's possible that the node you're connected to is following an obsolete fork - trying again after it catches up usually resolves the issue. To check for bigger problems, inspect the last finalized and current best block of the node you're connected to and compare the values to chain stats exposed by other nodes - are they in sync? If not, try connecting to a different node. Future Transaction nonce too high, i.e. it's \"from the future\". Reduce the nonce to +1 of current nonce. Check current nonce by inspecting the address you're using to send the transaction. Stale Transaction nonce too low. Increase the nonce to +1 of current nonce. Check current nonce by inspecting the address you're using to send the transaction. ExhaustsResources There aren't enough resources left in the current block to submit this transaction. Try again in the next block. Payment Unable to pay for TX fee. You might not have enough free balance to cover the fee this transaction would incur.

As in the example above, running a single validator would net you 2 SDX in this era.</p> <p>Note that while SDX is used as an example, this same formula would apply to KSI when running a validator on Kusari</p> <pre><code>Validator Set Size (v): 4\n\nACTIVE SET\nValidator 1 Stake (v1): 18 coins &lt;- YOUR VALIDATOR\nValidator 2 Stake (v2):  9 coins\nValidator 3 Stake (v3):  8 coins\nValidator 4 Stake (v4):  7 coins\n\nPAYOUT END OF THE ERA\nPayout (p): 8 SDX\n\nPAYOUT CALCULATION\nYour Payout = p / v = 8 / 4 = 2 SDX \n</code></pre> <p>Running two validators, and splitting the stake equally, would result in the original validator <code>v4</code> being kicked out of the validator set, as only the top v validators (as measured by stake) are selected to be in the validator set. More important, it would also double the reward that you get from each era.</p> <p><pre><code>Validator Set Size (v): 4\n\nACTIVE SET\nValidator 1 Stake (v1): 9 coins &lt;- YOUR FIRST VALIDATOR\nValidator 2 Stake (v2): 9 coins &lt;- YOUR SECOND VALIDATOR\nValidator 3 Stake (v3): 9 coins\nValidator 4 Stake (v4): 8 coins\n\nPAYOUT END OF ERA\nPayout (p): 8 SDX\n\nYour payout = (p / v) * 2 = (8 / 4) * 2 = 4 SDX\n</code></pre> With enough stake, you could run more than two validators. However, each validator must have enough stake behind it to be in the validator set.</p> <p>The system is designed to favor equally-staked validators. This works out to be a dynamic, rather than static, equilibrium. Potential validators will run different numbers of validators and apply different amounts of stake to them as time goes on and in response to the actions of other validators on the network.</p>"},{"location":"validator-guides/validator-payout-overview/#slashing","title":"Slashing","text":"<p>Although the system pays rewards equally, slashes are relative to a validator's stake. Therefore, if you do have enough KSI/SDX to run multiple validators, it is in your best interest to do so. Of course, a slash of 30% will be more KSI/SDX for a validator with 18 KSI/SDX staked than one with 9 KSI/SDX staked.</p> <p>Running multiple validators does not absolve you of the consequences of misbehavior. The network punishes attacks that appear coordinated more severely than individual attacks. You should not, for example, run multiple validators hosted on the same infrastructure. A proper multi-validator configuration would ensure that they do not fail simultaneously.</p> <p>Nominators have the incentive to nominate the lowest-staked validator, as this will result in the lowest risk and highest reward. This is because while their vulnerability to slashing remains the same (since it is percentage-based), their rewards are higher since they will be a higher proportion of the total stake allocated to that validator.</p> <p>To clarify this, let us imagine two validators, PETAR and GRANDAD. Assume both are in the active set, have commission set to 0%, and are well-behaved. The only difference is that GRANDAD has 90 SDX nominating it and PETAR only has 10. If you nominate GRANDAD, it now has 90 + 10 = 100 SDX, and you will get 10% of the staking rewards for the next era. </p> <p>If you nominate PETAR, it now has 10 + 10 = 20 SDX nominating it, and you will get 50% of the staking rewards for the next era. In actuality, it would be pretty rare to see such a significant difference between the stake of validators, but the same principle holds even for more minor differences. If there is a 10% slash of either validator, you will lose 1 SDX in each case.</p>"},{"location":"validator-guides/validator-payout-overview/#nominators-and-validator-payments","title":"Nominators and Validator Payments","text":"<p>Nominated stake allows you to \"vote\" for validators and share in the rewards (and slashing) without running a validator node yourself. Validators can choose to keep a percentage of the rewards due to their validator to \"reimburse\" themselves for the cost of running a validator node. Other than that, all rewards are shared based on the stake behind each validator. This includes the stake of the validator itself, plus any stake bonded by nominators.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Validators set their preference as a percentage of the block reward, not an absolute number of KSI/SDX. The block rewards are based on the total amount at stake, with the reward peaking when the amount staked is at 50% of the total supply. The commission is set as the amount taken by the validator; that is, 0% commission means that the validator does not receive any proportion of the rewards besides that owed to it from self-stake, and 100% commission means that the validator operator gets all rewards and gives none to its nominators.</p> <p>The following examples show the results of several different validator payment schemes and the split between nominator and validator stake. We will assume a single nominator for each validator. However, there can be numerous nominators for each validator. Rewards are still distributed proportionally - for example, if the total rewards to be given to nominators is 2 SDX, and there are four nominators with equal stake bonded, each will receive 0.5 SDX. Note also that a single nominator may stake different validators.</p> <p>Each validator in the example has selected a different validator payment (a percentage of the reward set aside directly for the validator). The validator's payment percentage (in SDX, although the same calculations work for KSI) is listed in brackets ([]) next to each validator. Since the validator payment is public knowledge, having a low or non-existent validator payment may attract more stake from nominators, since they know they will receive a larger reward.</p> <pre><code>Validator Set Size (v): 4\n\nACTIVE SET (One Nominator per Validator)\nValidator 1 Stake (v1) [20% commission]: 18 SDX (9 SDX self-stake, 9 SDX nominator-stake)\nValidator 2 Stake (v2) [40% commission]:  9 SDX (3 SDX self-stake, 6 SDX nominator-stake)\nValidator 3 Stake (v3) [10% commission]:  8 SDX (4 SDX self-stake, 4 SDX nominator-stake)\nValidator 4 Stake (v4) [0% commission]:   6 SDX (1 SDX self-stake, 5 SDX nominator-stake)\n\nTOTAL PAYOUT END OF ERA\nPayout (p): 8 DOT\n\nPAYOUT PER VALIDATOR\nPayout for each validator (v1 - v4):\np / v = 8 / 4 = 2 SDX\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREWARD CALCULATION - VALIDATOR 01\nv1:\n(0.2 * 2) = 0.4 SDX             -&gt; validator payment\n(2 - 0.4) = 1.6 SDX             -&gt; shared between all stake\n(9 / 18) * 1.6 = 0.8 SDX        -&gt; validator self-stake share\n(9 / 18) * 1.6 = 0.8 SDX        -&gt; nominator stake share\n\nv1 validator total reward: 0.4 + 0.8 = 1.2 SDX\nv1 nominator reward: 0.8 SDX\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREWARD CALCULATION - VALIDATOR 02\nv2:\n(0.4 * 2) = 0.8 SDX              -&gt; validator payment\n(2 - 0.8) = 1.2 SDX              -&gt; shared between all stake\n(3 / 9) * 1.2 = 0.4 SDX          -&gt; validator self-stake share\n(6 / 9) * 1.2 = 0.8 SDX          -&gt; nominator stake share\n\nv2 validator total reward: 0.8 + 0.4 = 1.2 SDX\nv2 nominator reward: 0.8 SDX\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREWARD CALCULATION - VALIDATOR 03\nv3:\n(0.1 * 2) = 0.2 SDX              -&gt; validator payment\n(2 - 0.2) = 1.8 SDX              -&gt; shared between all stake\n(4 / 8) * 1.8 = 0.9 SDX          -&gt; validator self-stake share\n(4 / 8) * 1.8 = 0.9 SDX          -&gt; nominator stake share\n\nv3 validator total reward: 0.2 + 0.9 SDX = 1.1 SDX\nv3 nominator reward: 0.9 SDX\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREWARD CALCULATION - VALIDATOR 03\nv4:\n(0 * 2) = 0 SDX                  -&gt; validator payment\n(2 - 0) = 2.0 SDX                -&gt; shared between all stake\n(1 / 6) * 2 = 0.33 SDX           -&gt; validator self-stake share\n(5 / 6) * 2 = 1.67 SDX           -&gt; nominator stake share\n\nv4 validator total reward: 0 + 0.33 SDX = 0.33 SDX\nv4 nominator reward: 1.67 SDX\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p> Written by Masterdubs &amp; Petar </p> <p> Edited by NoLongerVoid </p>"},{"location":"validator-guides/validator/","title":"HOW TO SETUP A VALIDATOR","text":"<p>The following guide will teach you how to set up a SwapDEX validator.

If your chosen validator makes it to the active set, he will earn rewards and ideally share them with all of his nominators.</p> <p>The main difference between a Validator and a Nominator is the active participation in the network. Validators engage in the block production and finality mechanisms, whereas nominators take a more passive role with the above mentioned \"set-it-and-forget-it\" approach. Being a nominator does not require running a node of your own or worrying about online uptime. However, a good nominator performs due diligence on the validators that they elect. When looking for validators to nominate, a nominator should pay attention to their reward percentage for nominating a specific validator - as well as the risk that they bear of being slashed if the validator gets slashed.</p>"},{"location":"what-to-try/nominator/#setting-up-controller-and-stash-accounts","title":"Setting up Controller and Stash Accounts","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>In this guide, we use the terms \"account\" and \"wallet\" interchangeably.</p> <p>Nominators are recommended to set up two separate stash and controller accounts.

Even if individual Councillors have that expertise, it is highly unlikely that a majority of members are capable in such diverse topics.</p> <p>Bounties Spending proposals aim to delegate the curation activity of spending proposals to experts called Curators: They can be defined as addresses with agency over a portion of the Treasury with the goal of fixing a bug or vulnerability, developing a strategy, or monitoring a set of tasks related to a specific topic: all for the benefit of the SwapDEX ecosystem.</p> <p>A proposer can submit a bounty proposal for the Council to pass, with a curator to be defined later, whose background and expertise is such that they are capable of determining when the task is complete. Curators are selected by the Council after the bounty proposal passes, and need to add an upfront payment to take the position. This deposit can be used to punish them if they act maliciously. However, if they are successful in their task of getting someone to complete the bounty work, they will receive their deposit back and part of the bounty reward.</p> <p>When submitting the value of the bounty, the proposer includes a reward for curators willing to invest their time and expertise in the task: this amount is included in the total value of the bounty. In this sense, the curator's fee can be defined as the result of subtracting the value paid to the bounty rewardee from the total value of the bounty.</p> <p>In general terms, curators are expected to have a well-balanced track record related to the issues the bounty tries to resolve: they should be at least knowledgeable on the topics the bounty touches, and show project management skills or experience. These recommendations ensure an effective use of the mechanism. A Bounty Spending is a reward for a specified body of work - or specified set of objectives - that needs to be executed for a predefined treasury amount to be paid out. The responsibility of assigning a payout address once the specified set of objectives is completed is delegated to the curator.</p> <p>After the Council has activated a bounty, it delegates the work that requires expertise to the curator who gets to close the active bounty. Closing the active bounty enacts a delayed payout to the payout address and a payout of the curator fee. The delay phase allows the Council to act if any issues arise.</p> <p>To minimize storage on chain in the same way as any proposal, bounties don't contain contextual information. When a user submits a bounty spending proposal, they will probably need to find an off-chain way to explain the proposal (any of the available community forums serve this purpose).

In an adversarial mindset, we may consider the possibility that the Council may at some point go rogue and attempt to steal all of the treasury funds. It is a possibility that the treasury pot becomes so great, that a large financial incentive would present itself.</p> <p>For one, the Treasury has deflationary pressure due to the burn that is suffered every spend period. The burn aims to incentivize the complete spend of all treasury funds at every burn period, so ideally the treasury pot doesn't have time to accumulate mass amounts of wealth. However, it is the case that the burn on the Treasury could be so little that it does not matter.</p> <p>However, it is the case on SwapDEX that the Council is composed of mainly well-known members of the community. Remember, the Council is voted in by the SDX holders, so they must do some campaigning or otherwise be recognized to earn votes. In the scenario of an attack, the Council members would lose their social credibility. Furthermore, members of the Council are usually externally motivated by the proper operation of the chain. This external motivation is either because they run businesses that depend on the chain, or they have direct financial gain (through their holdings) of the token value remaining steady.</p> <p>Concretely, there are a couple on-chain methods that resist this kind of attack. One, the Council majority may not be the token majority of the chain. This means that the token majority could vote to replace the Council if they attempted this attack - or even reverse the treasury spend. They would do this through a normal referendum. Two, there are time delays to treasury spends. They are only enacted every spend period. This means that there will be some time to observe this attack is taking place. The time delay then allows chain participants time to respond. The response may take the form of governance measures or - in the most extreme cases a liquidation of their holdings and a migration to a minority fork.
